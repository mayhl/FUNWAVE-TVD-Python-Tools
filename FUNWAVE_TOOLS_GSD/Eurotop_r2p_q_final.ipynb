    " # Eurotop codes for embankment to vertical walls\n",
    " Based on Matlab code made by Abigail L. Stehno \n",
    " (translated to Python by Gabriela Salgado)\n",
    "------------------\n",
    " This code's goal is to find the overtopping and runup values of smooth slopes or rubble mounds.\n",
    " This does not include vertical walls or armored structures because the logic for them is \n",
    " significantly different than with slopes. A seperate function should be written for them. \n",

    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "- Wave characteristics are at the toe of the structure\n",
    "- Equations are determined by emperical formula derived from experiment.\n",
    "- The use of Tm1-0 is used to accomodate complex spectral shapes.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### RUNUP:\n",
    " - Thin layers are not considered run-up (i.e. wind driven layers)\n",
    " - Runup height is measured when the thickness is approximately <= 2 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "### OVERTOPPING:\n",
    " - Average overtopping can only be calculated for quasi-stationary wave\n",
    "   and water level conditions, so for a time series, each set of \n",
    "   conditions must be calculated individually (not time dependent) \n",
    " - Eq 5.10 and 5.11 are only true for a freeboard -= 0; if the freeboard\n",
    "   is < 0, assume Rc = 0 for the calculation then use the weir eq\n",
    " - Eq 5.18 assumes relatively low freeboard, 0.36 < cota < 2.75, smooth \n",
    "   slopes, and non-breaking\n",
    " - Overflow eq coefficient 0.54 varies with structure type\n",
    " - Additional assumptions of overtopping volumes, velocities, and\n",
    "   thicknesses will be added when that code is implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### INFLUENCE FACTORS:\n",
    " - Found using reference tests or well-known formula for comparison, wave\n",
    "   conditions should be identical\n",
    " - Roughness (gamma_f)\n",
    "   - Grass has relatively greater hydraulic roughness for thin wave runup\n",
    "       depths, gamma_f will be conservative for grass\n",
    "   - Small Hm0 may effect roughness for all types of material; however,\n",
    "       standard gamma_f will give a conservative result\n",
    " - Oblique Wave Direction (gamma_beta_r2p)\n",
    "   - Assume runup and overtopping is equally distributed along the\n",
    "       longitudinal axis of a dike (this will decrease for convex curves \n",
    "       and increase for concave curves; however, this is not quatified)\n",
    "   - There is limited research for short crested gamma_beta_r2p - only \n",
    "       0 < beta < 80 has been tested\n",
    "   - Assume no significant influence of spreading widths for short crested\n",
    "       waves\n",
    "   - Assume a reduction in Hm0 and Tp for waves over 80 degrees, reducing\n",
    "       Hm0 and Tp to zero for angles greater or equal to 110 degrees\n",
    " - Currents are not currently considered; however, current effect\n",
    "   definitions were expanded from a limited amount of tests\n",
    " - Berms (gamma_b)\n",
    "   - Assume the point of breaking is 1.5 Hm0 below SWL\n",
    "   - Limitation of gamma_b = 0.6 corresponds to optimal width of \n",
    "       B = 0.4*Lm10 at SWL\n",
    " - Wave walls (gamma_v and gamma_star)\n",
    "   - Submerged foot is limited to slopes between 1:2.5 and 1:3.5 and the\n",
    "       foot of the wall is no lower than 1.2Hm0\n",
    "   - Wall on top of emerged slope assumes a straight, smooth seaward slope\n",
    "       of 1:2 or 1:3 (can also be average slope), valid for \n",
    "       0.01 < sm1-0 < 0.05, breaker parameter between 2.2-4.8, \n",
    "       Rc/Hmo - 0.6, and assumes that other gamma values are valid when\n",
    "       wall is present (only tested when gamma_f=gamma_beta=gamma_b= 1)\n",
    "   - Smooth dike slope and a storm wall is applicable for h_wall/Rc = 0.08\n",
    "       to 1 [ we are assuming all walls are of this nature ] \n",
    "\n",
    " SCALE EFFECTS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n",
    " - There are such large model uncertainties that no other uncertainties\n",
    "   need to be considered if the full standard deviation is added to the\n",
    "   coefficients\n",
    " - Frictional scale effects are not significant if gamma_f - 0.9,\n",
